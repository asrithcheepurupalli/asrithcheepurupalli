# Hi, I'm Asrith Cheepurupalli

I'm a computer science student who enjoys building tools that solve problems I personally care about. I like to finish what I start, and I’m most motivated when I’m building something useful — even if it’s just for myself.

## What I Do

- Full-stack development using Python, FastAPI, Flask, JavaScript, and React
- CLI tools and developer utilities that actually save time
- OpenAI and LangChain workflows, API integrations, and AI reasoning
- CI/CD pipelines, automation, and lightweight deployment flows
